  * A 'Play' button to pay the video
  * The 'Play' button will turn to 'Pause' button to be able as a user to paue the video anytime I want.
  * A 'Volume' bar where as a user I can scroll to increase or decrease the volume. 
  * A 'progess' bar just at the downside of the video where as a user see the progress of the played video and also I can scroll to chose which segment of the video I want to watch. 
  * The above functionalities need to be shown on a cursor hover
